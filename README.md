# parallax-effect
This is the first project I have made since I started learning front end. i have learnt about z-index, tranform and 3-D.This websites visuals are pretty cool 
if you observe closing the first section has 2 images which are overlapping each other
the background image-mountains.
the foreground image-red hoodie guy.
when we scroll the mountains are moving a little bit slower than the red hoodie guy.
that effect is created by positioning (absolute and relative) and using transform we are translating the images in the z-axis
